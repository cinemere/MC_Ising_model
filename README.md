# MC_Ising_model

Repository contains code and [report](report_ms-ising-model.pdf) of final project of MC methods course at Skoltech.

## Description

Ising model is one of the most simple models of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. This work is devoted to study two-dimensional square lattice Ising model via Monte-Carlo chains to explored effect of order-disorder phase transition which occurs in freezing-melting process of a nanoparticle.
