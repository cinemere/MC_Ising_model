Repository contains code and [report](report_ms-ising-model.pdf) of final project of MC methods course at Skoltech.

## Description

Ising model is one of the most simple models of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. This work is devoted to study two-dimensional square lattice Ising model via Monte-Carlo chains to explored effect of order-disorder phase transition which occurs in freezing-melting process of a nanoparticle.

This work can be considered as an overview of 2-D Ising model for nanoparticles. Melting and freezing processes were studied to investigate order-disorder phase transitions, observed stability of melting and instability of freezing (especially for large scales of nanoparticle). We observed the appearing of hysteresis with increasing nanoparticle scale and checked the theoretical value of Curie temperature $T_C$.
